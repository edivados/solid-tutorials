## Lesson

Sometimes your components and elements accept a variable number of attributes and it makes sense to pass them down as an object instead of individually. This is especially true when wrapping a DOM element in a component, a common practice when making design systems.

For this we use the spread operator `...`.

We can pass an object with a variable number of properties:

```jsx
<Info {...pkg} />
```


## Usage

```bash
$ npm install # or pnpm install or yarn install
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles Solid in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
